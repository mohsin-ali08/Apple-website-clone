"🚀 Excited to share my very first project on LinkedIn and GitHub: a responsive landing page for Apple!
I built this landing page using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, with a touch of JavaScript for added interactivity. It’s designed to be fully responsive and provide a seamless experience across devices.
